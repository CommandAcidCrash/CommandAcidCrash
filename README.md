- 👋 Hi, I’m @CommandAcidCrash
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding and hacking from an ethical hacking standpoint, so that I may hopefully better help protect myself and others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning beginner information as I am just beginning my journey of knowledge gain.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet, because i do not have nearly enough skill or knowledge to be able to help unfortunately.
- 📫 How to reach me- by email at CommandAcidCrash@proton.me
